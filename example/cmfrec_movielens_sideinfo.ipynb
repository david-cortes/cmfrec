    "# 1. Model description\n",
    "\n",
    "The colective matrix mactorization model is an extension of the typical low-rank matrix factorization model to incorporate user and/or item side information. In its most basic form, low-rank matrix factorization tries to find an approximation of a matrix $X$ given by two lower-rank matrices $A$ and $B$, which in recommender systems would represent, respectively, a matrix of latent factors for users and items, which are determined by minimizing the squared differences between their product and $X$, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ argmin_{A, B} \\lVert X - AB^T \\lVert$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic formula can be improved by adding regularization on the $A$ and $B$ matrices, as well as by centering the matrix $X$ by substracting its global mean for each entry, adding user and item biases, and considering only the non-missing entries, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ argmin_{A, B, U_b, I_b} \\lVert (X - \\mu - U_b - I_b - AB^T)I_{x} \\lVert^2 + \\lambda (\\lVert A\\lVert^2 + \\lVert B \\lVert^2 + \\lVert U_b \\lVert^2 + \\lVert I_b \\lVert^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $X$ is the ratings matrix (entry in row $\\{ i,j\\}$ contains the rating given by user $i$ to item $j$).\n",
    "* $A$ and $B$ are lower-dimensional matrices (model parameters).\n",
    "* $U_b$ is a column matrix of user biases, containing at each row a constant for its respective user.\n",
    "* $I_b$ is a row matrix of item biases, containing at each column a constant for its respective item.\n",
    "* $mu$ is the mean of the entries in $X$.\n",
    "* $I_x$ is an indicator matrix with entries in row $\\{i,j\\}$ equal to one when that same entry is present in the matrix $X$, and equal to zero when the corresponding entry is missing in $X$.\n",
    "* $\\lambda$ is a regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In collective matrix factorization, this model is further extended by also factorizing matrices of user and/or item side information (e.g. movie tags, user demographic info in tabular format, etc.)., e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ argmin_{A, B, C, D, U_b, I_b} \\lVert (X - \\mu - U_b - I_b - AB^T)I_{x} \\lVert^2 + \\lVert U - AC^T \\lVert^2 + \\lVert I - BD^T \\lVert^2 + \\lambda (\\lVert A\\lVert^2 + \\lVert B \\lVert^2 + \\lVert C \\lVert^2 + \\lVert D \\lVert^2  + \\lVert U_b \\lVert^2 + \\lVert I_b \\lVert^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, in addition to the previous model:\n",
    "* $U$ is the user side information matrix.\n",
    "* $I$ is the item side information matrix.\n",
    "* $C$ is a matrix of latent factors for user attributes (model parameters).\n",
    "* $D$ is a matrix of latent factors for item attributes (model parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Other variations such as different weights for each factorization, different regularization for each paramter, and most notably, applying a sigmoid function on factorized values for binary variables, among others, are also possible to fit with this package).\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, latent factors that also do a good job at explainin user/item attributes should generalize better to ratings data than latent factors that don't, even though it might adversely affect training error in the factorization of interest (the $X$ matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the package can also use a different formulation, in which the user and/or item attributes can be though of as the base of the factorization, with additional latent matrices acting as offsets for each user and item (deviations from its expected ratings according to the side information), e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ argmin_{A, B, C, D, U_b, I_b} \\lVert (X - \\mu - U_b - I_b - (UC + A)(ID + B)\\:)I_{x} \\lVert^2 + \\lambda (\\lVert A\\lVert^2 + \\lVert B \\lVert^2 + \\lVert C \\lVert^2 + \\lVert D \\lVert^2 + \\lVert U_b \\lVert^2 + \\lVert I_b \\lVert^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these models allow for making recommendations based only on user/item side information without ratings, in the first case by either training the model with extra users/items, or by computing the corresponding rows/columns of $A$ and $B$ by minimizing *only* the factorization of $U$ and $I$ (for a new user/item, there won't be any new entries in $C$ or $D$), which can be done in closed form; and in the second case, by setting the corresponding rows/columns of $A$ and $B$ to zero. As the ratings are centered, the expected value of both $U_b$ and $I_b$ are zero, which aids in cold-start recommendations.\n",
